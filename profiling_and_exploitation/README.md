### Acknowledgements

The cache attack tools have been borrowed from [IAIK's Cache Template Attacks](https://github.com/IAIK/cache_template_attacks) repository.  

### Description

* This work assumes you have studied Flush+Reload attacks and have used the mentioned tools to profile and come up with various potential memory addresses corresponding to characters for key-logging.
* The `exploitation` directory has tools to inspect individual memory addresses for hits through the `spy` tool which are in-turn used by `key-logger` script to perform actual spying.
* Replace the memory addresses in that script to the ones obtained through analysis of profiled result.
* Make sure to compile and link the `spy` binary using `make` command.
* Running the script should then result in correct key-logging of the character 'a' in `gedit`.
