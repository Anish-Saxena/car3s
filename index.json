Instruction prefetching is important because processors require instructions to execute and if they are not provided on time, then the processor stalls and it degrades performance.\nSolving this problem is hard because the program control flow jumps in an arbitrary fashion without any pattern and is made harder by multiple levels of abstractions like classes, dynamic link library, system calls etc. Prefetcher requires this arbitrary jump information to prefetch correctly, but it has huge storage overhead.
